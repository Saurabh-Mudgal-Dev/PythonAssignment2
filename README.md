# Gradebook Analyzer

#  Project Overview
The Gradebook Analyzer is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help teachers and administrators efficiently process student marks. It allows users to input data manually or via CSV, automatically calculates statistical metrics (Average, Median, Min, Max), assigns letter grades, and categorizes students based on Pass/Fail criteria.

#  Key Features
* **Flexible Input**: Choose between manual data entry or importing from a CSV file.

* **Statistical Analysis**: Automatically calculates the Arithmetic Mean, Median, Highest Score, and Lowest Score.

* **Automated Grading**: Assigns letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on predefined thresholds.

* **Pass/Fail Filtering**: Identifies students who passed (>= 40) and failed (< 40).

* **Menu-Driven Interface**: A continuous loop allows multiple analyses without restarting the program.

* **Detailed Reporting**: Displays a formatted table of results and grade distributions.

#  Prerequisites
* Python 3.x installed on your system.

* No external libraries are required (uses standard csv module).

#  How to Run
